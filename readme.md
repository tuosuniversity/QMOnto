- A formal ontology of the Quantum Mindfulness framework's Prime Modality. This version uses OWL restrictions to define relationships at the class level, ensuring a robust and machine-readable structure.
- A formal ontology of the psychodynamic architecture of consciousness as detailed in the Quantum Mindfulness source material. This model defines the sequential process from Observation to the emergence of a final Mental State, and the mechanism of Belief Formation.
- An ontology of the Quantum Mindfulness framework. Note: While some source texts refer to eleven dimensions, the detailed enumeration consistently lists ten (Pd1-Pd10). The concept of 'eleven' may allude to a foundational 'Psycho-Volitional core' that underpins the ten enumerable dimensions.

## 🧭 Overview

This ontology models the **formal psychodynamic architecture** underlying the Quantum Mindfulness framework. Unlike classical mindfulness approaches that emphasize passive observation and equanimity, Quantum Mindfulness focuses on **active structural transformation** of mental phenomena, perception, and inherent bias.

The ontology defines core concepts, structures, and processes that enable advanced cognitive operations such as:

- Active reframing of experience
- Modification of cognitive-affective bias (`Bias_M1`)
- Engagement with Prime Modality dimensions (Pd1–Pd3)
- Transformation of perceptual architecture

### 🧠 Use with NotebookLM and AI Assistants

This ontology is optimized for conceptual exploration, visual reasoning, and multi-modal interpretation in tools like NotebookLM, ChatGPT, and Gemini. Its size and structure make it ideal for semantic navigation and theory testing.

#### 📚 How to Use in NotebookLM
1.	Upload [**chatbot_primer.md**](chatbot_primer.md) into the file selection panel.
2.	Use structured, comparative, or exploratory prompts to query the ontology’s logic.

#### 🔍 Suggested Prompts

- “List and describe all ten psychodynamic dimensions.”
- “How does the ontology define and apply the concept of Bias_M1?”
- “Explain the cognitive role of Pd2 in restructuring subjective meaning.”
- “How does the Reframing Process alter the Prime Modality?”
- “In what ways does this ontology differ from classical mindfulness models?”
- “What structural mechanism links Valence(Ψ) to overall perception?”

#### 🌐 Visual Mind Maps

A mind map derived from the ontology is included (mindmap.svg) to assist in:
* Navigating complex class hierarchies at a glance 
* Identifying semantic depth (up to 5 levels in current model)
* Bridging ontology structure to conceptual grouping

This is particularly useful in:
* Education / teaching modules
*  Live workshop explanation
* LM visual context anchoring (when paired with .ttl)

⸻

#### 🔊 Audio Overviews and Narrative Exports

AI narration tools (e.g. ElevenLabs, LM audio chains) can generate audio walk-throughs of the ontology. You can:
* Create dimension-by-dimension narrations (e.g. “Pd1: Psycho-Volitional Dynamics”)
* Record module overviews for individual branches
* Stitch segments into a semantic podcast for immersive review or publication

This enhances cognitive retention and supports alternative learning modes—especially useful for theory incubation, reflection, and pedagogy.
